A Kotlin/Compose client built around Client1

The goal is to eventually offer a truly cross-platform client with a modern touch.  
Some enhancements are nice, but I intend to respect the experience.  
    
It currently offers:  
GPU upscaling / texture filtering via OpenCV  
Stretch to fit / fill  
  
* `/composeApp` 
  - `commonMain` where most ui code / non-jvm code should go eventually  
    `desktopMain` where all code currently resides. aka jvmMain  
  
Other platforms are not yet started

# 2004Scape Client

Status: **Completely renamed!** There's no obfuscation or unnamed classes/methods/fields/variables left.

The TeaVM webclient is in the `webclient` branch until it can be made compatible with this new branch: see https://github.com/2004scape/Client/tree/webclient

Thanks to these individuals' projects for shedding light on some things - this would've taken a lot longer to complete without their efforts.
