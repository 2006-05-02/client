OpenCV GPU upscaling  
Kotlin/Compose framework  
Vanilla launcher (no sound/injection)  
  
* `/annotations` various annotations related to RuneLite's lifecycle
* `/api` restricted-level interfaces to client members
* `/api-rs` unrestricted-level interfaces to client members
* `/composeApp` 
  - `commonMain` where most ui code / non-jvm code should go eventually  
    `desktopMain` where all code currently resides. aka jvmMain
* `/eventbus` custom KEvent eventbus
* `/injector` packs `api`/`api-rs`/`mixins` into `rs2`
* `/logger` simple logger implementation with support for ANSI color coding
* `/mixins` code to be packed/modified in `rs2`

# 2004Scape Client

Status: **Completely renamed!** There's no obfuscation or unnamed classes/methods/fields/variables left.

The TeaVM webclient is in the `webclient` branch until it can be made compatible with this new branch: see https://github.com/2004scape/Client/tree/webclient
