A Kotlin/Compose client built around Client1

The goal is to eventually offer a truly cross-platform client with a modern touch.  
Enhancements are nice, but I intend to respect the experience, and the developers of the project.  
    
It currently offers:  
RuneLite injection  
OpenCV GPU upscaling  
Kotlin/Compose framework

* `/annotations` various annotations related to RuneLite's lifecycle
* `/api` restricted-level interfaces to client members
* `/api-rs` unrestricted-level interfaces to client members
* `/composeApp` 
  - `commonMain` where most ui code / non-jvm code should go eventually  
    `desktopMain` where all code currently resides. aka jvmMain
* `/eventbus` custom KEvent eventbus
* `/injector` packs `api`/`api-rs`/`mixins` into `rs2`
* `/logger` simple logger implementation with support for ANSI color coding
* `/mixins` code to be packed/modified in `rs2`
* `/rs2` aka deob aka 2004Scape Client aka Client1
  
Other platforms are not yet started

# 2004Scape Client

Status: **Completely renamed!** There's no obfuscation or unnamed classes/methods/fields/variables left.

The TeaVM webclient is in the `webclient` branch until it can be made compatible with this new branch: see https://github.com/2004scape/Client/tree/webclient

Thanks to these individuals' projects for shedding light on some things - this would've taken a lot longer to complete without their efforts.
